								<section>
									<h3>Shell</h3>
									<p>Created a Linux shell from scratch using C as part of the Operating Systems & Networks course at IIIT-H. Implemented most common commands like cd, ls, pwd, echo, etc., while also handling support for foreground and background processes, including signals and interrupts.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>xv6 OS</h3>
									Tweaked the xv6 Operating System as part of the Operating Systems & Networks course at IIIT-H. Added two new system calls - strace and set_priority. <br>
									<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
										<li>strace traces the system calls made by a command.</li>
										<li>set_priority changes the priority level of a process to the value entered by the user.</li>
									</ul>
									Also implemented two new schedulers (FCFS and PBS), in addition to the default round-robin scheduler.
									<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
										<li>FCFS (First Come First Served) - The process which comes first is run first.</li>
										<li>PBS (Priority Based Scheduler) - The process with the highest priority is run first.</li>
									</ul>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Nautica</h3>
									<p>Created a 3D game using WebGL and ThreeJS as part of the Computer Graphics course at IIIT-H. Game involves moving across the ocean as a ship, while collecting treasure and destroying enemy ships. Destroying enemy ships causes a greater number of enemies to spawn. The game lasts as long as the user has health remaining.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Canteen Portal Website</h3>
									<p>Made a canteen portal website as part of the Design and Analysis of Software Systems course at IIIT-H. The website has the following features - </p>
									<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
										<li>Create/Edit profile for both buyer and vendor</li>
										<li>Login/Registration</li>
										<li>Vendors can add food items to their dashboard</li>
										<li>Buyers can see food items available from every vendor</li>
										<li>Buyers can search (fuzzy search) and filter according to their wish</li>
										<li>Buyers can update their wallet balance</li>
									</ul>
									Also packaged and deployed the website using Docker.
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Bitcoin Simulator</h3>
									Designed a bitcoin simulator as part of the Data Structures & Algorithms course at IIIT-H (group project of 5 people). The simulator has support for a large number of users and transactions. Each transaction is stored in a block structure and the entire program will have multiple such blocks - forming a blockchain. Each block also has a hash value for verification and security purposes. The simulator has several functions, some of which are - <br>
									<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
										<li>Adding users</li>
										<li>Conducting a transaction</li>
										<li>Hash function, to generate a hash value for each block</li>
									</ul>
									I was heavily involved in writing the code for the simulator, and also completely handled the design of test cases.
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Algorithms Website</h3>
									<p>Created a website as a guide for beginners to algorithms as part of the Algorithms Analysis & Design course at IIIT-H. The website had a simple UI, along with easy to understand explanations of several famous algorithms under Divide & Conquer, Greedy, and Dynamic Programming.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Parliament Database</h3>
									<p>Implemented a database based on the Indian Parliament System using MySQL and Python as part of the Data and Applications course at IIIT-H (group project of 3 people). The database stored some of the members of the lower and upper houses of the country, as well as the states councils. Also designed a Python program to query the database for selection and updation. I was mainly involved with the MySQL part of the project, which involved designing the database itself and adding the data.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Card Game</h3>
									<p>Simulated a card game called 99 using C++ as a personal project during my free time. In this game, the user plays against the computer, and the one who loses their cards the fastest is the winner. I created the code such that the computer always makes the best possible choice at every step.</p>
