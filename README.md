## Minimalist Portfolio — GitHub Pages

This is a clean, fast, and accessible single‑page portfolio suitable for GitHub Pages.

### Customize
- Update your name, bio, projects, and links in `index.html`.
- Replace the placeholder email (`you@example.com`) in the Contact section.
- Tweak colors/spacing/tokens in `styles.css` if you want a different vibe.

### Local preview
Open `index.html` in a browser (no build step needed).

### Deploy on GitHub Pages
Because this repo is named `benpaul2002.github.io`, GitHub serves it automatically:
1. Commit and push to the `main` branch.
2. In your repository settings → Pages, ensure Source is set to `Deploy from a branch`, branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`.
3. Your site will be live at `https://benpaul2002.github.io/` after the build completes.

### Notes
- `404.html` is included for client‑side routing friendliness on GitHub Pages.
- The theme toggle persists your choice (light/dark) in `localStorage`.
- Sections reveal on scroll; users with reduced motion won’t see animations.
